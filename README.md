# The Programmers Bookshelf

## Description
The programmers bookshelf is a collaboration of several developers to go through their bookshelf of technical materials, pick out interesting books, read through them for the first time or for the bazillionth time and then perform the exercises.

The goal is to first reinvigorate our own understanding of those books we paged through long ago. To reinforce everything we learn now through programming through each of the exercises. To apply years of industry knowledge if able or even just a new outlook if you are new to the industry. And finally to share socially the experience and results through code.

If you feel like this is an experience you'd like to participate in and would have time to do so feel free to request collaborator access to the repository.

## Potential Future Books:

[Introduction to Algorithms](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1378584548&sr=8-7&keywords=Skiena)

[Algorithms in C++, Parts 1-5](http://www.amazon.com/Bundle-Algorithms-Parts-1-5-Fundamentals/dp/020172684X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1378611781&sr=8-5&keywords=Sedgewick)

## Current Book

Decided on 9/12/2013 as the first book to tackle.

[Programming Challenges: The Programming Contest Training Manual](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Challenges-Contest-Training-Computer/dp/0387001638/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1378584494&sr=8-2&keywords=Skiena)

The following book was chosen as a supplement to the programming challenges book. We'll see how that works out.

[The Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1378584548&sr=8-1&keywords=Skiena)
